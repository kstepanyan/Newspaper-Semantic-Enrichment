# Newspaper-Semantic-Enrichment
The repository is developed to process a collection of articles extracted from the Pi newspaper and identify people, places and classify these into a set of topics. It links individual to Wikidata Q-IDs and adds geolocation information. The final output is a JSONL file which contains the article, the NER entities and newspaper metadata.
